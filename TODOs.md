# TODOs

## Before Alpha Testing

1. Deploy a staging server ([docs/deploy/hostinger.md](docs/deploy/hostinger.md)) with S3 backups and `SENTRY_DSN` set,
   and check a fresh server restores from those backups
1. Test end to end with real devices: Loop, Trio, AAPS and xDrip+ uploading, follower apps (xDrip+ follower, LoopFollow,
   Nightguard) reading, and Dexcom and Libre sync
1. Medical disclaimer: Nighttroop is not a medical device and its alarms are not to be relied on, shown when a site is
   created and on the alarm settings
1. Privacy policy and terms, linked from site creation: what is kept (credentials encrypted, logs), for how long, and
   who can see it
1. A site's admin can delete their site and all its data (sites are only deleted now when unused)
1. A way for testers to report bugs and give feedback, linked from the site
1. A tester guide: creating a site, keeping its credentials safe (they cannot be recovered), and connecting uploaders,
   followers and sync
1. Check the archive bug below is fixed

## Before Beta Testing

1. Reports/Derived Values:
    1. AGP
    1. Time below and above range, as well as time in range
    1. Small multiples Daily

1. Alarms:
    1. Push notifications to phones, as alarms now only reach an open site page or a Nightscout socket client

1. Bad Sites
    1. write entry compression
    1. write device status compression
    1. write treatments compressions

1. Control UI
    1. Show bad users
    1. Block IP addresses
    1. Show all rate limits for users
    1. Restore one site from its backup

1. Accounts
    1. Recovering a site's admin without the initial backup key
    1. Recovering a lost control admin login, as setup only runs on a server with no control admin

1. Security
    1. Testing deploy with rolling to a new keyset, moving to a new encrypted keyset.
    1. P3: Refresh the built in DB-IP country database (`utils/geoip/dbip-country-lite.mmdb`) each month or two, as
       DB-IP updates it monthly; the Docker image's city database is fetched fresh on each build.

## Before First Release:

1. Think about Translations
1. Docs hosting
1. Fuzz testing beyond the API (`tests/api/fuzz_test.go`)
1. Performance testing (cost estimate for running full node)

## Bugs

1. Archive has a problem where they are deleting files from the db not removing from control
